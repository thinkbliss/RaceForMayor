The Catalog House is a visual "landmark" along the North Branch of the Chicago River, closely hugging the riverbank with its dramatic, curving, 600-foot-long, trapezoidal form. This is one of the best examples of a Chicago School-style industrial building and a pioneering example of large-scale reinforced-concrete construction. Noted architectural historian Carl Condit said: "This building stands by itself as one of the most powerful works of utilitarian architecture that our building art has produced." The buildings geometric terra-cotta ornament is a rich, subtle variation on the modern decoration common to several Chicago School architects, including Louis H. Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. The building is listed as a National Historic Landmark due to its significance in the history of American retailing and association with A. Montgomery Ward. A later administration building (1929) and north additions (1917 and 1940) are not part of the Chicago Landmark designation.'

The school was founded by Mother Francis Xavier Cabrini (1850-1917), a nationally significant figure in the history of education, health care and social welfare and the first American to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. The school is the most intact building associated with her numerous charitable undertakings in the city. Designed in the Beaux Arts style by architect Frederick Foltz (1843-1916), the school is a distinctive example of a late-nineteenth century urban school building. The Assumption School Building is distinguished by its fine brick- and stonework, exuberant classically-inspired ornament and ornate copper cornice.'

The powerhouse was built by the North Chicago Street Railroad Company organized by Charles Tyson Yerkes, the leading transit entrepreneur in Chicago during the late 19th century. At the height of his influence, Yerkes controlled eight separate street railway companies and 250 miles of track in the city.<br/><br/>The powerhouse was constructed to house engines that moved two miles of cable through channels laid in streets on the Near North Side and in the Loop business district. Those cables, in turn, pulled the thousands of cable cars that, at the peak of their operation, brought approximately 100,000 workers into downtown Chicago each day. The LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse helped make possible the rapid development of the citys outlying North Side neighborhoods during one of the greatest boom periods in the history of Chicago.'

Built as a warehouse and office building for a wholesale grocery company, it was one of the first designs to respond to the 1909 Plan for Chicagos goal for riverfront redevelopment: docking facilities are recessed at the water level, while a promenade extends at street level. A bold Chicago School-style exterior highlights the buildings steel-and-concrete supporting frame, which is further enhanced by excellent brickwork and terra-cotta details. A central tower provides a strong counterpoint to the general horizontality of the structure, making this one of the best-known buildings along the Chicago River.'
